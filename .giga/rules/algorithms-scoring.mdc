description: Specification for documenting and analyzing core scoring algorithms and decision logic in investment analysis systems
---

# === USER INSTRUCTIONS ===

Analyze and document business-critical scoring algorithms, formulas, and decision logic for investment analysis and deal evaluation.

Core scoring components (with primary code locations):

1) Deal Confidence Scoring
- Location: `apps/web/src/components/report-templates/sections/AIConfidenceScores.tsx`
- Weighted confidence metrics across market, financial, team, and document quality (weights may vary by stage).
- Confidence bands (0–100):
  - Very High: 90+
  - High: 80–89
  - Medium: 65–79
  - Low: <65

2) Risk Assessment Matrix
- Location: `apps/web/src/components/report-templates/sections/RiskAssessment.tsx`
- Multi-dimensional risk scoring combining severity and probability.
- Categories: market, financial, team, competitive, legal/regulatory, execution.

3) Market Position Scoring
- Location: `apps/web/src/components/report-templates/sections/CompetitiveLandscape.tsx`
- Feature comparison and competitive positioning scoring.

4) Financial / ROI Signals (only if implemented in code)
- Location: `apps/web/src/components/report-templates/sections/FinancialAnalysis.tsx` (and any ROI components if present)
- Unit economics, burn/runway, revenue/growth where available.

Master deal score guidance (used for recommendation banding):
- 85–100: Strong invest
- 70–84: Consider
- 50–69: Watch
- 0–49: Pass

Core Scoring Components:

1. Deal Confidence Scoring
Path: apps/web/src/components/report-templates/sections/AIConfidenceScores.tsx
- Calculates weighted scores across 5 dimensions:
  * Market: Industry growth, TAM/SAM analysis, competition (30%)
  * Financial: Metrics, projections, unit economics (25%)  
  * Team: Experience, track record, completeness (20%)
  * Documents: Quality, completeness, validation (15%)
  * Risk: Technical, market, financial exposure (10%)
- Implements deal stage-specific scoring adjustments
- Auto-adjusts thresholds based on funding stage

2. Risk Assessment Engine
Path: apps/web/src/components/report-templates/sections/RiskAssessment.tsx
- Multi-factor risk scoring across 6 categories:
  * Market risk: Competition, timing, regulations
  * Execution risk: Technical feasibility, timeline
  * Financial risk: Runway, burn rate, funding needs
  * Technology risk: Stack maturity, scalability
  * Team risk: Experience gaps, key person dependencies
  * Timeline risk: Development roadmap, milestones
- Generates risk level classifications with weighted impact scores
- Implements risk mitigation recommendation engine

3. ROI Calculator System
Path: apps/web/src/components/report-templates/sections/ROISummary.tsx
- Industry-specific savings calculations:
  * Legal fees by deal stage and complexity
  * Due diligence time/cost based on deal size
  * Document preparation and analysis costs
  * Meeting and coordination time savings
- Role-based ROI projections (founder vs investor)
- Milestone-based savings tracking

4. Market Analysis Scoring 
Path: apps/web/src/components/report-templates/sections/MarketAnalysis.tsx
- TAM/SAM/SOM calculation methodology
- Competitive positioning scoring matrix
- Growth trajectory projections with confidence bands
- Industry-specific valuation multiple calculations

5. Investment Terms Analysis
Path: apps/web/src/lib/scoring/dealTerms.ts
- Equity structure optimization scoring
- Liquidation preference analysis engine
- Board composition recommendation system
- Investment terms validation framework
