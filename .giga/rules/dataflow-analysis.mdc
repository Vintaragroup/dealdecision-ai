description: Defines data flow analysis patterns for investment deal processing and document analysis pipeline
---


# dataflow-analysis

## Document Processing Pipeline
1. Document Ingestion Flow
- Files uploaded through batch uploader component
- Intelligent grouping by company name and document type
- Version detection and duplicate identification
- Assignment to relevant deal workspace

2. Analysis Pipeline Stages
- Initial document classification and metadata extraction
- Deep analysis with domain-specific LLM routing
- Evidence extraction and fact validation
- Integration with deal scoring system

3. Evidence Collection Flow
- Structured extraction of investment signals
- Citation tracking and source verification
- Confidence scoring for extracted facts
- Real-time evidence panel updates

## AI Analysis Integration
- Model router assigns tasks based on complexity
- Context compression optimizes token usage
- Multi-cycle analysis with increasing depth
- Structured output generation for deal insights

## Report Generation Flow
1. Template Selection
- Role-specific template catalogs
- Dynamic section organization
- Required vs optional component handling

2. Data Population
- Deal metrics integration
- Evidence-based content generation
- Risk assessment visualization
- Performance metric calculations

3. Export Pipeline
- Format-specific rendering (PDF, PPTX, DOCX)
- Watermarking and security controls
- Version tracking
- Distribution rules enforcement

## Key Integration Points
- Deal workspace → Analysis pipeline
- Evidence panel → Report generator
- Document processor → LLM router
- Analysis results → Deal scoring
- Template engine → Export system

## Data Flow Control
- Persistent state management between analysis cycles
- Real-time updates to workspace components
- Bidirectional sync between evidence and reports
- Progressive loading of analysis results
