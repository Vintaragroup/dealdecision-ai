description: Rules and logic for evaluating investment deals, managing risk assessment, and conducting due diligence
1. Deal Scoring Framework
- Weighted scoring across 4 key dimensions:
  * Market Opportunity (30%)
  * Team Assessment (25%) 
  * Financial Health (25%)
  * Risk Profile (20%)
- Threshold requirements:
  * Minimum 70% overall score for "Recommended"
  * No dimension below 60%
  * Risk score must not exceed critical thresholds
2. Due Diligence Requirements
- Mandatory document verification checklist:
  * Corporate governance documents
  * Financial statements (3 years minimum)
  * Customer contracts (top 3 minimum)
  * Team employment agreements
- Progressive validation stages:
  * Initial Review (completeness check)
  * Deep Analysis (content verification)
  * Expert Validation (specialist review)
3. Risk Assessment Matrix
  * Critical (16-25 points)
  * High (10-15 points)
  * Medium (5-9 points)  
  * Low (1-4 points)
- Impact categories:
  * Financial Impact
  * Market Position
  * Operational Viability
  * Legal/Regulatory
  * Team Stability
4. Investment Decision Criteria
- Stage-specific thresholds:
  * Seed: Focus on team/market (70% weight)
  * Series A: Traction/metrics emphasis (60% weight)
  * Series B+: Financial performance priority (50% weight)
- Automatic rejection triggers:
  * Critical risk factors identified
  * Incomplete mandatory documentation
  * Failed validation checks
5. Validation Rules
- Document authenticity requirements:
  * Original source verification
  * Digital signature validation
  * Version control tracking
- Financial metric thresholds:
  * Growth rate minimums by stage
  * Burn rate limits
  * Revenue validation rules

INVESTMENT DEAL ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK
1. Deal Evaluation Logic
- Multi-stage scoring system (0-100) across 6 key dimensions:
  - Market Opportunity (25%)
  - Team Capability (20%) 
  - Financial Health (20%)
  - Product/Tech (15%)
  - Competition (10%)
  - Deal Terms (10%)
- Stage-specific validation thresholds:
  - Seed: 65+ composite score
  - Series A: 75+ composite score
  - Series B+: 85+ composite score
2. Risk Assessment Framework
- Risk severity classification:
  - Critical (blocks deal progress)
  - High (requires mitigation)
  - Medium (needs monitoring)
  - Low (acceptable risk)
- Automated risk detection rules:
  - Financial: burn rate > 18 months runway
  - Team: key role gaps, founder experience
  - Market: TAM validation, growth rate
  - Competition: market share analysis
- Stage-based document requirements:
  - Seed: pitch deck, financial model, team bios
  - Series A: + customer data, market analysis
  - Series B+: + detailed unit economics, compliance
- Verification thresholds:
  - Document completeness (90%+)
  - Data validation (85%+)
  - Source credibility (75%+)
- GO decision requires:
  - Composite score above stage threshold
  - No critical risks outstanding
  - Due diligence completion >= 90%
  - Evidence confidence >= 85%
- NO-GO triggers:
  - Any unmitigated critical risks
  - Composite score < stage threshold
  - Missing core documentation
  - Failed verification checks
5. AI Confidence Scoring
- Three-tier confidence bands:
  - High: 85-100%
  - Medium: 70-84%
  - Low: < 70%
- Confidence adjustments based on:
  - Data completeness
  - Source verification
  - Analysis depth
  - Evidence quality

Deal Analysis Scoring Framework:
- Multi-dimensional scoring across 5 key categories:
  1. Market Analysis (25%)
  2. Financial Projections (25%) 
  3. Team Assessment (20%)
  4. Document Completeness (15%)
  5. Risk Assessment (15%)
- Custom confidence scoring with thresholds per category
- Red/yellow/green flag generation based on domain rules

Risk Assessment Matrix:
- 6 core risk domains with weighted impact:
  1. Market Risk (0.25)
  2. Execution Risk (0.20) 
  3. Financial Risk (0.20)
  4. Technology Risk (0.15)
  5. Team Risk (0.10)
  6. Timeline Risk (0.10)
- Risk severity levels: Low (0-33), Medium (34-66), High (67-100)
- Mitigation requirement thresholds based on severity

Due Diligence Validation Rules:
- Critical document requirements by deal stage
- Completion percentage calculations with weighted sections
- Three-state verification (missing, partial, complete)
- Blocking rules for critical validation failures

Deal Stage Progression Logic:
- Automated stage transitions based on validation rules:
  1. Intake -> Under Review: Initial doc requirements met
  2. Under Review -> In Diligence: Analysis score > 65
  3. In Diligence -> Ready Decision: Risk assessment complete
- Manual override controls with approval workflow

Financial Metric Thresholds:
- Industry-specific benchmarks for key metrics:
  - SaaS: MRR, CAC, LTV, Churn
  - Marketplace: GMV, Take Rate
  - Hardware: Margins, BOM Costs
- Stage-appropriate target ranges
- Red flag triggers for out-of-range values

Deal Classification Rules:
- Multi-signal classifier using:
  - Document contents 
  - Financial metrics
  - Team composition
  - Market signals
- Confidence scoring for classification accuracy
- Industry-specific validation criteria
