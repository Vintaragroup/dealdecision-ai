Core Data Models:

1. Deal Entity Model (Importance: 95)
```typescript
interface Deal {
  id: string
  stage: 'intake' | 'under_review' | 'in_diligence' | 'ready_decision' | 'pitched'
  priority: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low'
  status: 'active' | 'hold' | 'closed'
  evidence: Evidence[]
  documents: Document[]
  analysis: Analysis[]
}
```

2. Evidence Model (Importance: 90)
```typescript
interface Evidence {
  id: string
  source: Document
  category: 'market' | 'financial' | 'team' | 'product' | 'risk'
  confidence: number // 0-100
  verification: 'pending' | 'verified' | 'rejected'
  claims: Claim[]
}
```

3. Document Intelligence Model (Importance: 85)
```typescript
interface Document {
  id: string
  type: 'pitch_deck' | 'financials' | 'legal' | 'market' | 'team'
  status: 'pending' | 'processing' | 'analyzed'
  evidenceCount: number
  confidence: number // 0-100
  metadata: DocumentMetadata
}
```

4. Analysis Entity (Importance: 90)
```typescript
interface Analysis {
  id: string
  type: 'market' | 'financial' | 'team' | 'risk' | 'product'
  score: number // 0-100
  evidence: Evidence[]
  recommendations: string[]
  status: 'draft' | 'review' | 'final'
}
```

Key Relationships:
- Deal 1:N Evidence
- Evidence N:1 Document
- Deal 1:N Analysis
- Evidence N:N Claims

State Transitions:
1. Deal Pipeline (Analysis-Driven Workflow)
   - intake (documents uploaded) -> under_review (analysis complete) -> in_diligence (DD gaps addressed) -> ready_decision (confidence >= 70%) -> pitched (decision made)
   - Progression triggered by: document upload, analysis completion, confidence score, investor actions
   - Manual override available from any stage to "pitched"

2. Evidence Processing
   - Document Upload -> Evidence Extraction -> Verification
   - Claims linked during extraction phase
   - Confidence scores updated on verification

3. Analysis Workflow
   - Draft created with initial evidence
   - Review triggered at evidence threshold
   - Final version requires minimum confidence scores

Domain Rules:
- Deals require minimum evidence threshold per category
- Evidence must link to verifiable document source
- Analysis scores weighted by evidence confidence
- Document intelligence extracts structured claims
- Deal stages gate certain analysis requirements
