# === USER INSTRUCTIONS ===
stage: 'intake' | 'under_review' | 'in_diligence' | 'ready_decision' | 'pitched'
1. Deal Pipeline (Analysis-Driven Workflow)
   - intake (documents uploaded) -> under_review (analysis complete) -> in_diligence (DD gaps addressed) -> ready_decision (confidence >= 70%) -> pitched (decision made)
   - Progression triggered by: document upload, analysis completion, confidence score, investor actions
   - Manual override available from any stage to "pitched"

description: Documentation for investment domain data models including Deal, Evidence, Document, and Analysis entities
Core Investment Domain Models:
1. Deal Model
- Multi-state progression tracking (intake → under_review → in_diligence → ready_decision)
- Evidence requirements mapped to stages
- Custom scoring matrix for deal evaluation:
  - Market score (0-100)
  - Team score (0-100) 
  - Financial health (0-100)
  - Risk assessment (0-100)
2. Evidence Model
- Hierarchical evidence structure with parent-child relationships
- Evidence confidence scoring (0-100)
- Source verification status tracking
- Citation mapping to original documents
- Evidence type classification system
3. Document Model 
- Document classification system (pitch_deck, financials, legal, etc.)
- Version control with temporal tracking
- Quality scoring framework:
  - Completeness score
  - Clarity score
  - Reliability score
- Document relationship mapping
4. Analysis Model
- Three-cycle analysis framework:
  - Cycle 1: Initial scan
  - Cycle 2: Deep dive
  - Cycle 3: Synthesis
- Analysis depth tracking
- Finding confidence metrics
- Citation requirement enforcement
Key Domain Relationships:
- Deals contain multiple Evidence entries
- Evidence links to source Documents
- Analysis tracks Evidence progression
- Documents support multiple Evidence points
Core Model Dependencies:
- Deal progression requires Evidence thresholds
- Evidence requires Document validation
- Analysis requires Evidence confidence
- Document scores impact Evidence reliability
Importance Scores:
- Deal Model: 95/100 (Core business entity)
- Evidence Model: 90/100 (Critical for validation)
- Document Model: 85/100 (Source of truth)  
- Analysis Model: 90/100 (Key business process)

## Core Domain Models
### Deal Model
- Uniquely structured investment opportunity representation
- Status progression: Intake -> Under Review -> In Diligence -> Ready Decision
- Confidence scoring (0-100) across multiple dimensions:
  - Market opportunity
  - Team capability  
  - Financial health
  - Execution risk
- Custom validation rules for stage transitions
- Priority classification with weighted scoring
### Evidence Model
- Investment-specific evidence classification system
- Evidence types: metrics, facts, quotes, references
- Confidence scoring (0-100) with source attribution
- Multi-stage verification workflow
- Context preservation with deal linkage
### Document Model 
- Domain-specific document categorization
- Types: pitch_deck, financials, legal, market, team
- Extraction quality scoring (0-100)
- Version control with relationship mapping
- Document-to-deal matching logic
### Analysis Model
- Multi-cycle analysis framework (Cycles 1-3)
- Composite scoring across dimensions
- Evidence aggregation with confidence thresholds
- Industry-specific benchmarking rules
- Risk severity classification
## State Transitions
Deal Stage Progression:
```
Intake (50+ confidence)
  -> Under Review (65+ confidence) 
    -> In Diligence (80+ confidence)
      -> Ready Decision (90+ confidence)
```
Document Status Flow:
```
Uploaded -> Extracted -> Verified -> Analyzed -> Referenced
```
Evidence Validation:
```
Collected -> Verified -> Scored -> Integrated
```
## Key Relationships
- Deal <-> Documents (1:many)
- Deal <-> Evidence (1:many) 
- Document <-> Evidence (1:many)
- Analysis <-> Evidence (many:many)
## Validation Rules
- Deal progression requires minimum confidence thresholds
- Document extraction quality gates
- Evidence source verification requirements
- Analysis cycle completion criteria
