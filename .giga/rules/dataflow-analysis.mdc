description: Analyzes data flow patterns in deal analysis systems and document processing pipelines
Primary Data Flow Components:
1. Document Processing Pipeline
- Input: Raw deal documents (PDF, PPTX, DOCX)
- Processing stages:
  * Document classification and grouping
  * Content extraction and structuring
  * Evidence detection and validation
  * Quality scoring and verification
- Output: Structured deal evidence with confidence scores
2. Evidence Collection Flow
- Structured fact gathering from documents
- Multi-source verification system
- Progressive confidence scoring
- Citation tracking and validation
- Evidence completeness assessment
3. Analysis Integration Flow
- Deal data aggregation from multiple sources
- AI model integration points for analysis
- Human-in-the-loop validation gates 
- Progressive depth assessment tracking
- Analysis state management through cycles
4. Report Generation Pipeline
- Evidence collection and validation
- Confidence score aggregation
- Risk assessment compilation
- Recommendation synthesis
- Template-based report assembly
Key Data Transformations:
1. Document → Evidence
- Document classification
- Content extraction
- Fact detection
- Citation mapping
- Confidence scoring
2. Evidence → Analysis
- Fact aggregation
- Pattern detection
- Risk assessment
- Depth calculation
- Cycle progression
3. Analysis → Reports
- Finding synthesis
- Score compilation
- Risk mapping
- Recommendation generation
Critical Data Points:
- Document confidence scores
- Evidence validation status
- Analysis depth metrics
- Risk assessment values
- Recommendation confidence

# dataflow-analysis

The system implements a multi-stage data flow for investment deal analysis:

1. Document Processing Pipeline
- Input: Raw documents (pitch decks, financials, legal docs)
- Processing stages:
  * Text extraction with OCR fallback
  * Intelligent categorization by document type
  * Metric/data point extraction
  * Evidence collection and validation
- Output: Normalized document data with confidence scores

2. Evidence Extraction Flow
- Input: Processed documents
- Extraction workflow:
  * Fact identification and extraction
  * Source attribution tracking
  * Confidence scoring (0-100)
  * Cross-validation against multiple sources
- Output: Verified evidence objects

3. AI Analysis Integration
- Input: Evidence objects
- Analysis stages:
  * Market opportunity scoring
  * Team assessment
  * Financial health calculation
  * Risk severity mapping
- Output: Analysis results with confidence bands

4. Report Generation Pipeline
- Input: Analysis results and evidence
- Generation flow:
  * Section template selection
  * Evidence mapping to sections
  * Dynamic content generation
  * Risk assessment incorporation
- Output: Structured investment reports

5. Data Quality Control Flow
- Confidence thresholds at each stage (70%+ required)
- Remediation workflows for low-confidence data
- Version tracking for processed documents
- Evidence validation state management

The system maintains strict data quality controls through:
- Multi-stage validation gates
- Confidence scoring at each step
- Source attribution tracking
- Version control for processed data

Data flows through specialized processors:
- Document classification engine
- Evidence extraction system
- Analysis orchestration service
- Report compilation engine
- Quality control framework
