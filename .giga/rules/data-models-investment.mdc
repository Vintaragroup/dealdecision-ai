# === USER INSTRUCTIONS ===
stage: 'intake' | 'under_review' | 'in_diligence' | 'ready_decision' | 'pitched'
1. Deal Pipeline (Analysis-Driven Workflow)
   - intake (documents uploaded) -> under_review (analysis complete) -> in_diligence (DD gaps addressed) -> ready_decision (confidence >= 70%) -> pitched (decision made)
   - Progression triggered by: document upload, analysis completion, confidence score, investor actions
   - Manual override available from any stage to "pitched"
