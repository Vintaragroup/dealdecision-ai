# === USER INSTRUCTIONS ===
Analyze and document business-critical scoring algorithms, formulas, and decision logic for investment analysis and deal evaluation.

Core scoring components (with primary code locations):

1) Deal Confidence Scoring
- Location: `apps/web/src/components/report-templates/sections/AIConfidenceScores.tsx`
- Weighted confidence metrics across market, financial, team, and document quality (weights may vary by stage).
- Confidence bands (0–100):
  - Very High: 90+
  - High: 80–89
  - Medium: 65–79
  - Low: <65

2) Risk Assessment Matrix
- Location: `apps/web/src/components/report-templates/sections/RiskAssessment.tsx`
- Multi-dimensional risk scoring combining severity and probability.
- Categories: market, financial, team, competitive, legal/regulatory, execution.

3) Market Position Scoring
- Location: `apps/web/src/components/report-templates/sections/CompetitiveLandscape.tsx`
- Feature comparison and competitive positioning scoring.

4) Financial / ROI Signals (only if implemented in code)
- Location: `apps/web/src/components/report-templates/sections/FinancialAnalysis.tsx` (and any ROI components if present)
- Unit economics, burn/runway, revenue/growth where available.

Master deal score guidance (used for recommendation banding):
- 85–100: Strong invest
- 70–84: Consider
- 50–69: Watch
- 0–49: Pass

- Calculates weighted scores across 5 dimensions:
  * Market: Industry growth, TAM/SAM analysis, competition (30%)
  * Financial: Metrics, projections, unit economics (25%)  
  * Team: Experience, track record, completeness (20%)
  * Documents: Quality, completeness, validation (15%)
  * Risk: Technical, market, financial exposure (10%)
- Implements deal stage-specific scoring adjustments
- Auto-adjusts thresholds based on funding stage
2. Risk Assessment Engine
- Multi-factor risk scoring across 6 categories:
  * Market risk: Competition, timing, regulations
  * Execution risk: Technical feasibility, timeline
  * Financial risk: Runway, burn rate, funding needs
  * Technology risk: Stack maturity, scalability
  * Team risk: Experience gaps, key person dependencies
  * Timeline risk: Development roadmap, milestones
- Generates risk level classifications with weighted impact scores
- Implements risk mitigation recommendation engine
3. ROI Calculator System
- Industry-specific savings calculations:
  * Legal fees by deal stage and complexity
  * Due diligence time/cost based on deal size
  * Document preparation and analysis costs
  * Meeting and coordination time savings
- Role-based ROI projections (founder vs investor)
- Milestone-based savings tracking
4. Market Analysis Scoring 
- TAM/SAM/SOM calculation methodology
- Competitive positioning scoring matrix
- Growth trajectory projections with confidence bands
- Industry-specific valuation multiple calculations
5. Investment Terms Analysis
Path: apps/web/src/lib/scoring/dealTerms.ts
- Equity structure optimization scoring
- Liquidation preference analysis engine
- Board composition recommendation system
- Investment terms validation framework

Core Scoring Algorithms:

1. Deal Confidence Scoring
Path: apps/web/src/components/report-templates/sections/AIConfidenceScores.tsx
- Sophisticated confidence calculation across 5 dimensions:
  * Market Fit (0-100): TAM alignment, growth potential, competitive position
  * Team Capability (0-100): Experience match, domain expertise, past exits
  * Financial Health (0-100): Unit economics, margins, burn rate, runway
  * Execution Risk (0-100): Technical feasibility, regulatory exposure, operational complexity
  * Investment Terms (0-100): Structure fairness, protection mechanisms, exit alignment
- Weighted scoring formula combining dimensional scores with industry-specific weights
- Confidence thresholds:
  * 90-100: Very High Confidence
  * 80-89: High Confidence
  * 70-79: Moderate Confidence
  * 60-69: Low Confidence
  * <60: Very Low Confidence
Importance Score: 95

2. Risk Assessment Framework
Path: apps/web/src/components/report-templates/sections/RiskAssessment.tsx
