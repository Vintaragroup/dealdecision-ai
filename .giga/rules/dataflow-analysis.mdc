description: Analyzes data flow patterns in deal analysis systems and document processing pipelines
Primary Data Flow Components:
1. Document Processing Pipeline
- Input: Raw deal documents (PDF, PPTX, DOCX)
- Processing stages:
  * Document classification and grouping
  * Content extraction and structuring
  * Evidence detection and validation
  * Quality scoring and verification
- Output: Structured deal evidence with confidence scores
2. Evidence Collection Flow
- Structured fact gathering from documents
- Multi-source verification system
- Progressive confidence scoring
- Citation tracking and validation
- Evidence completeness assessment
3. Analysis Integration Flow
- Deal data aggregation from multiple sources
- AI model integration points for analysis
- Human-in-the-loop validation gates 
- Progressive depth assessment tracking
- Analysis state management through cycles
4. Report Generation Pipeline
- Evidence collection and validation
- Confidence score aggregation
- Risk assessment compilation
- Recommendation synthesis
- Template-based report assembly
Key Data Transformations:
1. Document → Evidence
- Document classification
- Content extraction
- Fact detection
- Citation mapping
- Confidence scoring
2. Evidence → Analysis
- Fact aggregation

description: For analyzing data flow patterns in investment deal analysis systems, focusing on document processing pipelines and report generation workflows.
The system implements a multi-stage data flow for investment deal analysis:
- Input: Raw documents (pitch decks, financials, legal docs)
  * Text extraction with OCR fallback
  * Intelligent categorization by document type
  * Metric/data point extraction
  * Evidence collection and validation
- Output: Normalized document data with confidence scores
2. Evidence Extraction Flow
- Input: Processed documents
- Extraction workflow:
  * Fact identification and extraction
  * Source attribution tracking
  * Confidence scoring (0-100)
  * Cross-validation against multiple sources
- Output: Verified evidence objects
3. AI Analysis Integration
- Input: Evidence objects
- Analysis stages:
  * Market opportunity scoring
  * Team assessment
  * Financial health calculation
  * Risk severity mapping
- Output: Analysis results with confidence bands
- Input: Analysis results and evidence
- Generation flow:
  * Section template selection
  * Evidence mapping to sections
  * Dynamic content generation
  * Risk assessment incorporation
- Output: Structured investment reports
5. Data Quality Control Flow
- Confidence thresholds at each stage (70%+ required)
- Remediation workflows for low-confidence data
- Version tracking for processed documents
- Evidence validation state management
The system maintains strict data quality controls through:
- Multi-stage validation gates
- Confidence scoring at each step
- Source attribution tracking
- Version control for processed data
Data flows through specialized processors:
- Document classification engine
- Evidence extraction system
- Analysis orchestration service
- Report compilation engine
- Quality control framework

## Document Processing Pipeline

Primary document flow through system:
1. Upload → Initial Classification → Content Extraction → Evidence Tagging → Analysis Pipeline
2. Document metadata and extracted content flows into Deal Intelligence Object (DIO)
3. Evidence items flow to validation system with confidence scoring
4. Verified evidence feeds into analysis cycles

File: packages/core/src/orchestration/pipeline.ts
- Three-phase analysis cycles: Broad Scan → Deep Dive → Synthesis
- Evidence collection triggers progression between cycles
- Confidence thresholds gate movement to next phase
Importance Score: 90

## Evidence Extraction Flow

Document evidence flows through specialized extractors:
1. Visual Asset Extractor
   - Table detection with grid analysis
   - Chart data extraction with axis mapping
   - Business metric pattern matching
2. Text Content Extractor
   - Financial metric identification 
   - Team/market claim extraction
   - Risk factor detection

File: packages/core/src/services/evidence/service.ts
- Evidence categorization by type and confidence
- Cross-reference validation between sources
- Evidence-to-claim mapping system
Importance Score: 85

## AI Analysis Integration

Analysis request flow:
1. Document → Classification → Task Router → Model Selection → Analysis
2. Results flow through validation before entering DIO
3. Confidence scores determine reanalysis needs

File: packages/core/src/services/llm/service.ts
- Purpose-specific routing logic
- Domain-optimized model selection
- Investment-specific prompt engineering
Importance Score: 80

## Report Generation Workflow

Data aggregation flow:
1. DIO → Evidence Selection → Section Generation → Report Assembly
2. Evidence confidence scores influence section inclusion
3. Risk factors flow into recommendation generation

File: packages/core/src/services/report/generator.ts
- Section-specific evidence thresholds
- Risk-adjusted recommendation logic
- Deal stage-specific report templates
Importance Score: 75
