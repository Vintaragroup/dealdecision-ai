# === USER INSTRUCTIONS ===
Analyze and document business-critical scoring algorithms, formulas, and decision logic for investment analysis and deal evaluation.

Core scoring components (with primary code locations):

1) Deal Confidence Scoring
- Location: `apps/web/src/components/report-templates/sections/AIConfidenceScores.tsx`
- Weighted confidence metrics across market, financial, team, and document quality (weights may vary by stage).
- Confidence bands (0–100):
  - Very High: 90+
  - High: 80–89
  - Medium: 65–79
  - Low: <65

2) Risk Assessment Matrix
- Location: `apps/web/src/components/report-templates/sections/RiskAssessment.tsx`
- Multi-dimensional risk scoring combining severity and probability.
- Categories: market, financial, team, competitive, legal/regulatory, execution.

3) Market Position Scoring
- Location: `apps/web/src/components/report-templates/sections/CompetitiveLandscape.tsx`
- Feature comparison and competitive positioning scoring.

4) Financial / ROI Signals (only if implemented in code)
- Location: `apps/web/src/components/report-templates/sections/FinancialAnalysis.tsx` (and any ROI components if present)
- Unit economics, burn/runway, revenue/growth where available.

Master deal score guidance (used for recommendation banding):
- 85–100: Strong invest
- 70–84: Consider
- 50–69: Watch
- 0–49: Pass

- Calculates weighted scores across 5 dimensions:
  * Market: Industry growth, TAM/SAM analysis, competition (30%)
  * Financial: Metrics, projections, unit economics (25%)  
  * Team: Experience, track record, completeness (20%)
  * Documents: Quality, completeness, validation (15%)
  * Risk: Technical, market, financial exposure (10%)
- Implements deal stage-specific scoring adjustments
- Auto-adjusts thresholds based on funding stage
2. Risk Assessment Engine
- Multi-factor risk scoring across 6 categories:
  * Market risk: Competition, timing, regulations
  * Execution risk: Technical feasibility, timeline
  * Financial risk: Runway, burn rate, funding needs
  * Technology risk: Stack maturity, scalability
  * Team risk: Experience gaps, key person dependencies
  * Timeline risk: Development roadmap, milestones
- Generates risk level classifications with weighted impact scores
- Implements risk mitigation recommendation engine
3. ROI Calculator System
- Industry-specific savings calculations:
  * Legal fees by deal stage and complexity
  * Due diligence time/cost based on deal size
  * Document preparation and analysis costs
  * Meeting and coordination time savings
- Role-based ROI projections (founder vs investor)
- Milestone-based savings tracking
4. Market Analysis Scoring 
- TAM/SAM/SOM calculation methodology
- Competitive positioning scoring matrix
- Growth trajectory projections with confidence bands
- Industry-specific valuation multiple calculations
5. Investment Terms Analysis
Path: apps/web/src/lib/scoring/dealTerms.ts
- Equity structure optimization scoring
- Liquidation preference analysis engine
- Board composition recommendation system
- Investment terms validation framework

Core Scoring Components:

1. Deal Confidence Scoring
Path: src/scoring/deal-confidence.ts
- Multi-dimensional scoring across 5 categories (Market, Team, Financial, Product, Risk)
- Each category weighted based on deal stage:
  * Seed: Team (35%), Product (25%), Market (20%), Financial (10%), Risk (10%) 
  * Series A+: Financial (30%), Traction (25%), Team (20%), Market (15%), Risk (10%)
- Individual metric scoring with normalized 0-100 scale
- Confidence bands calculation based on evidence coverage
Importance Score: 95/100

2. Risk Assessment Matrix
Path: src/scoring/risk-matrix.ts
- 4x4 probability/impact matrix for risk categorization
- Impact levels: Critical (100), Major (75), Moderate (50), Minor (25)
- Probability levels: Very Likely (100), Likely (75), Possible (50), Unlikely (25)
- Composite risk score = Impact * Probability / 100
Importance Score: 85/100

3. Investment ROI Calculator
Path: src/scoring/roi-calculator.ts
- Time savings calculation based on deal complexity factors:
  * Document count (multiplier 1.1-2.0)
  * Industry type (multiplier 1.0-1.5)
  * Deal stage (multiplier 1.0-2.5)
- Cost savings based on industry benchmarks for:
  * Legal fees ($15-50k)
  * Consultant fees ($10-30k)
  * Analysis time (40-120 hours)
Importance Score: 80/100

4. Market Analysis Score
Path: src/scoring/market-analysis.ts
- TAM/SAM/SOM validation with confidence scoring
- Growth rate assessment against industry benchmarks
- Competitive position scoring across 6 dimensions
- Market timing risk adjustment factors
Importance Score: 90/100

5. Financial Health Score
Path: src/scoring/financial-health.ts
- Burn rate analysis with runway calculation
- Unit economics validation (CAC, LTV, Margins)
- Revenue quality scoring (ARR, MRR, Churn)
- Growth trajectory assessment
Importance Score: 85/100
