# dataflow-analysis

Primary Data Flow Components:

1. Document Processing Pipeline
- Input: Raw deal documents (PDF, PPTX, DOCX)
- Processing stages:
  * Document classification and grouping
  * Content extraction and structuring
  * Evidence detection and validation
  * Quality scoring and verification
- Output: Structured deal evidence with confidence scores

2. Evidence Collection Flow
- Structured fact gathering from documents
- Multi-source verification system
- Progressive confidence scoring
- Citation tracking and validation
- Evidence completeness assessment

3. Analysis Integration Flow
- Deal data aggregation from multiple sources
- AI model integration points for analysis
- Human-in-the-loop validation gates 
- Progressive depth assessment tracking
- Analysis state management through cycles

4. Report Generation Pipeline
- Evidence collection and validation
- Confidence score aggregation
- Risk assessment compilation
- Recommendation synthesis
- Template-based report assembly

Key Data Transformations:

1. Document → Evidence
- Document classification
- Content extraction
- Fact detection
- Citation mapping
- Confidence scoring

2. Evidence → Analysis
- Fact aggregation
- Pattern detection
- Risk assessment
- Depth calculation
- Cycle progression

3. Analysis → Reports
- Finding synthesis
- Score compilation
- Risk mapping
- Recommendation generation

Critical Data Points:
- Document confidence scores
- Evidence validation status
- Analysis depth metrics
- Risk assessment values
- Recommendation confidence
