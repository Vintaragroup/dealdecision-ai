# === USER INSTRUCTIONS ===
Analyze and document business-critical scoring algorithms, formulas, and decision logic for investment analysis and deal evaluation.

Core scoring components (with primary code locations):

1) Deal Confidence Scoring
- Location: `apps/web/src/components/report-templates/sections/AIConfidenceScores.tsx`
- Weighted confidence metrics across market, financial, team, and document quality (weights may vary by stage).
- Confidence bands (0–100):
  - Very High: 90+
  - High: 80–89
  - Medium: 65–79
  - Low: <65

2) Risk Assessment Matrix
- Location: `apps/web/src/components/report-templates/sections/RiskAssessment.tsx`
- Multi-dimensional risk scoring combining severity and probability.
- Categories: market, financial, team, competitive, legal/regulatory, execution.

3) Market Position Scoring
- Location: `apps/web/src/components/report-templates/sections/CompetitiveLandscape.tsx`
- Feature comparison and competitive positioning scoring.

4) Financial / ROI Signals (only if implemented in code)
- Location: `apps/web/src/components/report-templates/sections/FinancialAnalysis.tsx` (and any ROI components if present)
- Unit economics, burn/runway, revenue/growth where available.

Master deal score guidance (used for recommendation banding):
- 85–100: Strong invest
- 70–84: Consider
- 50–69: Watch
- 0–49: Pass

- Calculates weighted scores across 5 dimensions:
  * Market: Industry growth, TAM/SAM analysis, competition (30%)
  * Financial: Metrics, projections, unit economics (25%)  
  * Team: Experience, track record, completeness (20%)
  * Documents: Quality, completeness, validation (15%)
  * Risk: Technical, market, financial exposure (10%)
- Implements deal stage-specific scoring adjustments
- Auto-adjusts thresholds based on funding stage
2. Risk Assessment Engine
- Multi-factor risk scoring across 6 categories:
  * Market risk: Competition, timing, regulations
  * Execution risk: Technical feasibility, timeline
  * Financial risk: Runway, burn rate, funding needs
  * Technology risk: Stack maturity, scalability
  * Team risk: Experience gaps, key person dependencies
  * Timeline risk: Development roadmap, milestones
- Generates risk level classifications with weighted impact scores
- Implements risk mitigation recommendation engine
3. ROI Calculator System
- Industry-specific savings calculations:
  * Legal fees by deal stage and complexity
  * Due diligence time/cost based on deal size
  * Document preparation and analysis costs
  * Meeting and coordination time savings
- Role-based ROI projections (founder vs investor)
- Milestone-based savings tracking
4. Market Analysis Scoring 
- TAM/SAM/SOM calculation methodology
- Competitive positioning scoring matrix
- Growth trajectory projections with confidence bands
- Industry-specific valuation multiple calculations
5. Investment Terms Analysis
Path: apps/web/src/lib/scoring/dealTerms.ts
- Equity structure optimization scoring
- Liquidation preference analysis engine
- Board composition recommendation system
- Investment terms validation framework

Deal Confidence Scoring System
- Multi-dimensional confidence calculation across 5 key metrics:
  - Market Analysis: Market size validation, growth metrics, competitive positioning
  - Financial Health: Revenue modeling, burn rate assessment, runway calculations
  - Team Assessment: Background verification scores, network strength analysis
  - Document Coverage: Completeness validation, critical document scoring
  - Risk Assessment: Probability-weighted risk factor aggregation

Core Scoring Formulas:
```
Market Score = (TAM_confidence * 0.3) + (growth_metrics * 0.4) + (competitive_position * 0.3)
Financial Score = (revenue_model * 0.35) + (burn_rate * 0.35) + (runway * 0.3)
Team Score = (background_check * 0.4) + (network_strength * 0.3) + (domain_exp * 0.3)
Document Score = (completeness * 0.6) + (quality * 0.4)
Risk Score = 100 - (sum(risk_factors * probability))
```

Weighted Risk Aggregation
- Six risk categories with dynamic weightings:
  - Market Risk: 25%
  - Financial Risk: 25% 
  - Team Risk: 20%
  - Product Risk: 15%
  - Legal Risk: 10%
  - Competitive Risk: 5%

ROI Projection Engine
- Time-based savings calculations
- Service cost comparison matrices
- Value generation tracking
- Custom multipliers by industry:
  - SaaS: 1.2x
  - Consumer: 0.9x
  - Enterprise: 1.4x
  - Hardware: 0.8x

Deal Terms Analysis
- Liquidation preference waterfall calculations
- Cap table modeling with security type factors
- Ownership dilution projections
- Protective provision impact scoring
- Board composition analysis

Investment Recommendation Engine
Importance Score: 95
- Multi-factor decision matrix:
  - Strong Buy: Combined score > 85
  - Buy: Combined score 70-84
  - Hold: Combined score 50-69
  - Pass: Combined score < 50
- Confidence thresholds:
  - High: >80% evidence coverage
  - Medium: 60-80% evidence coverage
  - Low: <60% evidence coverage
