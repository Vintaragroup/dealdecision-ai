## Financial Readiness (Extraction → Evidence → Financial Health)

This section is generated by [apps/worker/scripts/trace_audit/financial_readiness.js](../../apps/worker/scripts/trace_audit/financial_readiness.js) and reads only existing trace artifacts (plus DB-backed evidence when `DATABASE_URL` is present).

How to run:
- Without DB evidence: `pnpm --filter worker trace:financial-readiness`
- With DB evidence: `DATABASE_URL=... pnpm --filter worker trace:financial-readiness`

Output per run:
- `docs/trace/<dealId>/<runId>/FINANCIAL_READINESS.json`
- `docs/trace/<dealId>/<runId>/FINANCIAL_READINESS.md`

Rollup output:
- `docs/trace_audit/FINANCIAL_READINESS_ROLLUP.json`

### One-paragraph summary per deal

- Vintara Group LLC: Financial docs detected (heuristic: yes). Structured extraction flags `runway_months`, but there is an evidence materialization gap for runway. Financial Health is `insufficient_data` because the orchestrator input only contains `extracted_metrics` with non-financial names (mostly `numeric_value`, plus `gross_margin`), so the analyzer detects `no_financial_signals`.
- 3ICE: Financial docs detected (heuristic: yes via textSummary including “FINANCIALS”). Structured extraction flags `arr_mrr`, but there is an evidence materialization gap. Financial Health is `insufficient_data` because the orchestrator input `extracted_metrics` are all named `numeric_value`, which the analyzer cannot map to revenue/cash/burn/runway signals (`no_financial_signals`).
- Bar Capital NJ Consolidation Strategy: Financial docs detected (heuristic: yes). Structured extraction flags `revenue` and evidence includes multiple `revenue` rows (no evidence gap for the extracted signal). Financial Health is still `insufficient_data` due to `missing_runway` (no cash+burn/expenses and no extracted runway metric name in `extracted_metrics`).
- BrandPoint Services PCC vF: Financial docs detected (heuristic: yes). Structured extraction flags `revenue`, but there is an evidence materialization gap (no matching evidence rows). Financial Health is `insufficient_data` due to `missing_runway` (no cash+burn/expenses and no extracted runway metric name).
- OFT _ TOXYCREEN: Financial docs not detected (heuristic: no) and structured extraction finds no financial signals. Financial Health is `insufficient_data` because orchestrator `extracted_metrics` contain only `slide_title`, resulting in `no_financial_signals`.

### Confirmed blind spots (from this trace set)

- No Excel/spreadsheet-heavy trace runs exist in `docs/trace` right now, so we cannot validate the spreadsheet extraction → evidence → Financial Health path from trace artifacts.
- For pitch-deck-like docs in this trace set, `07_orchestrator_inputs.json` shows Financial Health input is dominated by generic extracted metric names (e.g., `numeric_value`, `slide_title`, `gross_margin`) rather than the analyzer-recognized names (`cash_balance`, `burn_rate`, `runway_months/runway`). This leads to `insufficient_data` as either `no_financial_signals` or `missing_runway`.
