3. Risk Assessment Matrix

INVESTMENT DEAL ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK
1. Deal Evaluation Logic
- Multi-stage scoring system (0-100) across 6 key dimensions:
  - Market Opportunity (25%)
  - Team Capability (20%) 
  - Financial Health (20%)
  - Product/Tech (15%)
  - Competition (10%)
  - Deal Terms (10%)
- Stage-specific validation thresholds:
  - Seed: 65+ composite score
  - Series A: 75+ composite score
  - Series B+: 85+ composite score
2. Risk Assessment Framework
- Risk severity classification:
  - Critical (blocks deal progress)
  - High (requires mitigation)
  - Medium (needs monitoring)
  - Low (acceptable risk)
- Automated risk detection rules:
  - Financial: burn rate > 18 months runway
  - Team: key role gaps, founder experience
  - Market: TAM validation, growth rate
  - Competition: market share analysis
- Stage-based document requirements:
  - Seed: pitch deck, financial model, team bios
  - Series A: + customer data, market analysis
  - Series B+: + detailed unit economics, compliance
- Verification thresholds:
  - Document completeness (90%+)
  - Data validation (85%+)
  - Source credibility (75%+)
- GO decision requires:
  - Composite score above stage threshold
  - No critical risks outstanding
  - Due diligence completion >= 90%
  - Evidence confidence >= 85%
- NO-GO triggers:
  - Any unmitigated critical risks
  - Composite score < stage threshold
  - Missing core documentation
  - Failed verification checks
5. AI Confidence Scoring
- Three-tier confidence bands:
  - High: 85-100%
  - Medium: 70-84%
  - Low: < 70%
- Confidence adjustments based on:
  - Data completeness
  - Source verification
  - Analysis depth
  - Evidence quality
