Core Scoring Algorithms:

1. Deal Confidence Scoring (85/100)
- 5-dimension investment scoring matrix:
  - Market opportunity (25%)
  - Team capability (20%) 
  - Financial health (20%)
  - Product maturity (20%)
  - Competition (15%)
- Category-specific weighted calculations
- Confidence thresholds: Low (<60), Medium (60-80), High (>80)

2. Risk Assessment Engine (88/100)
- 6-category risk evaluation:
  - Market risks
  - Team risks
  - Financial risks
  - Technology risks
  - Legal risks
  - Competition risks
- Risk level determination:
  - Low: Score 0-3
  - Medium: Score 4-6  
  - High: Score 7-10
- Weighted risk aggregation formula
- Risk mitigation effectiveness tracking

3. ROI Projection System (82/100)
- Cost savings calculations:
  - Legal fees reduction
  - Consultant cost avoidance
  - Research time savings
  - Design/presentation costs
- Time-to-value measurements
- Resource allocation optimization
- Service comparison matrices

4. Market Analysis Scoring (85/100)
- TAM/SAM/SOM calculations
- Market growth rate analysis
- Competitive positioning matrix
- Market share projection formulas
- Industry-specific multipliers

5. Investment Due Diligence Framework (90/100)
- Deal terms analysis
- Liquidation preference calculations
- Investment waterfall modeling
- Cap table management
- Dilution impact scoring

The scoring algorithms implement industry-standard investment analysis methodologies with proprietary weightings and thresholds. The system uses multi-dimensional analysis combining quantitative metrics with qualitative assessments.
