# algorithms-scoring

Investment Scoring Components:

1. Deal Confidence Scoring
- Multi-dimensional scoring across market, financial, team factors
- Weighted validation metrics with source verification checks
- Custom confidence thresholds by deal stage
- Domain-specific scoring calibration
Importance Score: 85/100

2. Risk Assessment Engine
- Multi-dimensional risk scoring with probability/impact matrix
- Risk categorization with severity weighting 
- Automated mitigation strategy generation
- Custom risk profile calculations
Importance Score: 90/100

3. ROI Projection System
- Revenue and profitability forecasting algorithms
- Unit economics calculations (LTV, CAC, margins)
- Break-even analysis formulas
- Market share projection models
Importance Score: 85/100

4. Market Analysis Calculator
- TAM/SAM/SOM calculation framework
- Competitive positioning algorithms 
- Market growth rate formulas
- Industry-specific multipliers
Importance Score: 80/100

Core Algorithms:

1. Deal Score = Σ(Market*0.3 + Team*0.25 + Financial*0.25 + Traction*0.2)
2. Risk Level = Probability * Impact * TrendFactor
3. ROI = (ProjectedValue * Ownership%) - InvestmentAmount
4. Market Score = TAM * GrowthRate * CompetitivePosition

Decision Logic:
- Invest: Score ≥ 85, Risk ≤ Medium
- Consider: Score ≥ 70, Risk ≤ High
- Pass: Score < 70 or Risk = Critical

Validation Rules:
- Minimum 3 data sources per metric
- Confidence threshold ≥ 80%
- Risk severity alignment within 15%
- Market size validation within 25% range
