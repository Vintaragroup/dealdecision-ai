# DealDecision AI — Prompt Reference (VS Code / Copilot)

## Purpose
These prompts are used to scaffold, explain, or extend the system — not to replace reasoning.

## Example: Explain Risk
Explain the reasoning behind the distribution risk rating using only the current Deal Intelligence Object. Cite evidence IDs.

## Example: Propose Deeper DD
Identify gaps in regulatory diligence and propose a targeted re-analysis cycle. Do not assert new facts.

## Example: Workspace Research
Generate research queries for premium tequila distribution trends in the U.S. Do not cite sources.

## Guardrails
- Prompts must respect .mdc rules
- No prompt may request invention of facts or citations
