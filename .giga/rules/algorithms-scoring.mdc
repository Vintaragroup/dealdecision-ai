---

# === USER INSTRUCTIONS ===
Analyze and document business-critical scoring algorithms, formulas, and decision logic for investment analysis and deal evaluation.

Core scoring components (with primary code locations):

1) Deal Confidence Scoring
- Location: `apps/web/src/components/report-templates/sections/AIConfidenceScores.tsx`
- Weighted confidence metrics across market, financial, team, and document quality (weights may vary by stage).
- Confidence bands (0–100):
  - Very High: 90+
  - High: 80–89
  - Medium: 65–79
  - Low: <65

2) Risk Assessment Matrix
- Location: `apps/web/src/components/report-templates/sections/RiskAssessment.tsx`
- Multi-dimensional risk scoring combining severity and probability.
- Categories: market, financial, team, competitive, legal/regulatory, execution.

3) Market Position Scoring
- Location: `apps/web/src/components/report-templates/sections/CompetitiveLandscape.tsx`
- Feature comparison and competitive positioning scoring.

4) Financial / ROI Signals (only if implemented in code)
- Location: `apps/web/src/components/report-templates/sections/FinancialAnalysis.tsx` (and any ROI components if present)
- Unit economics, burn/runway, revenue/growth where available.

Master deal score guidance (used for recommendation banding):
- 85–100: Strong invest
- 70–84: Consider
- 50–69: Watch
- 0–49: Pass

- Calculates weighted scores across 5 dimensions:
  * Market: Industry growth, TAM/SAM analysis, competition (30%)
  * Financial: Metrics, projections, unit economics (25%)  
  * Team: Experience, track record, completeness (20%)
  * Documents: Quality, completeness, validation (15%)
  * Risk: Technical, market, financial exposure (10%)
- Implements deal stage-specific scoring adjustments
- Auto-adjusts thresholds based on funding stage
2. Risk Assessment Engine
- Multi-factor risk scoring across 6 categories:
  * Market risk: Competition, timing, regulations
  * Execution risk: Technical feasibility, timeline
  * Financial risk: Runway, burn rate, funding needs
  * Technology risk: Stack maturity, scalability
  * Team risk: Experience gaps, key person dependencies
  * Timeline risk: Development roadmap, milestones
- Generates risk level classifications with weighted impact scores
- Implements risk mitigation recommendation engine
3. ROI Calculator System
- Industry-specific savings calculations:
  * Legal fees by deal stage and complexity
  * Due diligence time/cost based on deal size
  * Document preparation and analysis costs
  * Meeting and coordination time savings
- Role-based ROI projections (founder vs investor)
- Milestone-based savings tracking
4. Market Analysis Scoring 
- TAM/SAM/SOM calculation methodology
- Competitive positioning scoring matrix
- Growth trajectory projections with confidence bands
- Industry-specific valuation multiple calculations
5. Investment Terms Analysis
Path: apps/web/src/lib/scoring/dealTerms.ts
- Equity structure optimization scoring
- Liquidation preference analysis engine
- Board composition recommendation system
- Investment terms validation framework

Core Scoring Components:

1. Deal Confidence Scoring
Path: apps/web/src/components/report-templates/sections/AIConfidenceScores.tsx
- Multi-dimensional confidence calculation across 5 key metrics:
  - Document quality (25%)
  - Data completeness (20%)  
  - Source reliability (20%)
  - Market validation (20%)
  - Team verification (15%)
- Classification thresholds:
  - High confidence: >85%
  - Medium confidence: 65-85%
  - Low confidence: <65%
Importance Score: 90

2. Risk Assessment Algorithm
Path: apps/web/src/components/report-templates/sections/RiskAssessment.tsx
- Risk severity scoring using probability x impact matrix
- Six key risk categories (market, financial, team, execution, legal, competitive)
- Automated mitigation suggestion system
- Weighted category scoring based on deal stage
Importance Score: 85

3. ROI Projection Engine
Path: apps/web/src/components/report-templates/sections/ROISummary.tsx
- Multi-factor ROI calculation incorporating:
  - Cost savings across legal, due diligence, research
  - Time value analysis with 3-year projection
  - Efficiency gains by category
  - Value generation metrics
- Configurable by deal type and stage
Importance Score: 80

4. Market Analysis Formulas
Path: apps/web/src/components/report-templates/sections/MarketAnalysis.tsx
- TAM/SAM/SOM calculations
- Market growth trajectory scoring
- Competitive positioning matrix
- Industry-specific multiplier adjustments
Importance Score: 75

Key Weighting System:
- Document confidence: 25-40% depending on deal stage
- Market metrics: 15-30% based on industry
- Team assessment: 15-25% weighted by experience
- Financial analysis: 20-35% by deal size
- Risk factors: 10-20% by deal type

Decision Logic:
Strong Yes: >85% composite score
Yes: 70-85% composite score
Maybe: 50-70% composite score
Pass: <50% composite score
