description: Analyzes and documents business-critical scoring algorithms, formulas and decision logic for investment analysis and deal evaluation.
Core Scoring Components:
1. Deal Confidence Scoring
Location: apps/web/src/components/report-templates/sections/AIConfidenceScores.tsx
- Weighted confidence metrics across market (30%), financial (25%), team (25%), docs (20%)
- Domain thresholds: Very High (90+), High (80-89), Medium (65-79), Low (<65)
- Multi-source validation with cross-reference checking
Importance Score: 90
2. Risk Assessment Matrix
Location: apps/web/src/components/report-templates/sections/RiskAssessment.tsx
- Multi-dimensional risk scoring combining severity and probability
- Risk categories: market, financial, team, competitive, legal
- Impact calculations with weighted domain factors
- Mitigation effectiveness scoring
Importance Score: 85
3. Market Position Scoring
Location: apps/web/src/components/report-templates/sections/CompetitiveLandscape.tsx
- Market share distribution analysis
- Feature comparison scoring matrix
- Competitive positioning metrics

4. ROI Projection Engine
Location: apps/web/src/components/report-templates/sections/FinancialAnalysis.tsx
- Unit economics calculations (LTV/CAC)
- Custom revenue projection modeling
- Financial health scoring system
- Burn rate analysis
Importance Score: 85
Core Algorithms:
1. Deal Analysis Score = 
   (Market Score * 0.3) + 
   (Financial Score * 0.25) + 
   (Team Score * 0.25) + 
   (Documentation Score * 0.2)
2. Risk Impact Score =
   Severity Level (1-5) * 
   Probability Factor (0.2-1.0) * 
   Domain Weight
3. Market Position Score =
   (Market Share * 0.4) +
   (Feature Score * 0.3) +
   (Growth Rate * 0.3)
4. Financial Health Score =
   (Unit Economics * 0.35) +
   (Burn Rate * 0.25) +
   (Revenue Growth * 0.25) +
   (Margins * 0.15)

- Low (multiplier: 1.0)
3. ROI Projection Engine
Importance Score: 85/100
Calculations include:
- Time savings ROI:
  - Legal fee reductions
  - Analyst time savings
  - Due diligence acceleration
- Cost savings ROI:
  - Consultant fee reduction
  - Travel cost elimination
  - Process automation gains
4. Market Analysis Engine
Importance Score: 85/100
Key metrics:
- TAM/SAM/SOM calculations

- Competitive positioning score
- Market penetration potential
- Entry barrier assessment
All scoring components feed into the master deal score (0-100) which drives investment recommendations:
Deal Score Thresholds:
- 85-100: Strong invest
- 70-84: Consider 
- 50-69: Watch
- 0-49: Pass
